# USFX

This is a very simple SAX Document and Nokogiri SAX Parser for reading [Unified Scripture Format XML](http://ebible.org/usfx/) (USFX) files as a stream and doing something interesting with the verse data.

I needed to get the World English Bible (WEB) into a database easily and efficiently, so this was born. This parser excludes footnotes and other content other than the verse text itself, which may or may not be what you want.

Pull requests welcome!

## Install

```
gem install usfx
```

## Use

You can get the World English Bible (WEB) in USFX format [here](http://ebible.org/web/). Unzip and put the usfx.xml file somewhere.

```ruby
require 'usfx'

class MyDocument < USFX::Document
  def verse(data)
    # do something with verse data, which looks like:
    # {
    #   book_num: 1,
    #   book_id: 'GEN',
    #   book: 'Genesis',
    #   chapter: 1,
    #   verse: 1,
    #   text: 'In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.'
    # }
  end
end

parser = USFX::Parser.new(MyDocument.new)
parser.parse(File.open('eng-web_usfx.xml'))
```
